**Describe your use case.**
Ex. *"Build Docker images based on existing Dockerfiles and push them to a remote registry"*

**Describe the problem you found.**
Ex. *"The Docker images are built, but I cannot see them in the registry"*

**Include the pipeline files generated by the SQAaaS platform (if any).**
Those are: `config.yml`, `docker-compose.yml` and `Jenkinsfile`.

**Include the link to the Jenkins job (if triggered).**
The URL would be good enough.
